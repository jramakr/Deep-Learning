# DeepLearning
This repository contains deep learning projects, completed as part of course work for Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree with Udacity in 2017.

### Dog Breed Classifier
This notebook makes the first steps towards developing an algorithm that could be used as part of a mobile or web app. The code implements a Convolutional Neural Network using Keras over Tensorflow.
The code will accept any user-supplied image as input. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling. 

### RNN Project

This notebook contains a variety of tasks solving 2 problems- Time Series and Sequence Generation, using a Recurrent Neural Network architecture of type LSTM(Long Term Short Memory.)
It is divided as a list of tasks:-
1. Implement a function to window time series
2. Create a simple RNN model using keras to perform regression
3. Finish cleaning a large text corpus
4. Implement a function to window a large text corpus
5. Create a simple RNN model using keras to perform multiclass classification
6. Generate text using a fully trained RNN model and a variety of input sequences
